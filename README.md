# What is a Font Renderer
A Font Renderer takes the vector description from a font file, in this case a TrueTypeFont file (.ttf) and then interprets those vectors to draw the glyphs onto the screen. You can read more on the TrueTypeFont format at https://developer.apple.com/fonts/TrueType-Reference-Manual/ and https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/typography/truetype/
